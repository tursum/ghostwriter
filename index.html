					<p>Dear Friend,</p>
					<p>My name is Ruby Peru and I ghostwrite memoirs for a living. I am the very best at what I do for one simple reason: I'm the only memoir ghostwriter I know of who uses humorous ghostwriting to heighten and explore the events of your life.</p>
					<p>I don't write stand-up routines.</p>
					<p>I don't write jokes.</p>
					<p>I ghostwrite memoirs in an easy-going, novel-like style that brings out the best in your personality. I use humorous ghostwriting because it keeps readers reading, and it's the most natural style for me.</p>
					<p>In fact, I consider this humorous ghostwriting style a strength of mine—a unique take on the world that few other writers have mastered.</p>
					<p>Events of the past can't be changed, yet how you and I look at those events can. By taking a lighthearted view of life's ups and downs, we insulate ourselves from the tendency to let triumphs go to our heads and failures, to our hearts.</p>
					<p>That said, I don't know of another memoir ghostwriter on the internet who exhibits my unique understanding of irony and playfulness. This style elevates the meaning of each scene, enabling readers to laugh even as they cry.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 ruby-speachs">
					<p>Are you looking for a humorous ghostwriter to help bring your story to life?</p>
					<p>Are you concerned that the style of the book not only reflect your personality but enhance it?</p>
					<p>If the answer is yes, then I can help.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Find Your Voice: <span>Using a Ghostwriter to Tell Your Life Story</span></h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
					<p>I have over a decade of ghostwriting experience and have studied with masters including the great Kurt Vonnegut, best-selling novelist David Foster Wallace, award-winning memoirist Thom Jones, actor Alan Arkin, and poet and New York Quarterly founder William Packard.</p>
					<p>I have learned from these exceptional authors that great stories don't present themselves whole but must be nurtured, cultivated, and developed into maturity.</p>
					<p>In fact, when the most heart-breaking scenes of your life are depicted with subtle wit and strong emotion, readers intuit that hindsight has given you perspective, perhaps even a new philosophy. Here lies the difference between autobiography (little more than a recounting of life's events) and true memoir, where the writer (sometimes through a ghostwriter) offers insights upon a theme in his or her life.</p>
					<p>My approach to story development ensures your memoir will build, through action and suspense, to a dramatic ending that shows how you have changed and what you have learned.</p>
					<p>My clients have included immigrants, artists, business owners, gamblers, sportsmen, ministers, and adventurers. They each offer a unique viewpoint stemming from life's risks and revelations. Over my ghostwriting years, I have created a wide range of narrative voices in order to tell these true-life stories.</p>
					<p>One benefit of choosing me as your ghostwriter is that you will come away from the ghostwriting experience feeling that, for once, you have been understood. People who can laugh at their triumphs and wrong turns show a hard-won maturity, and that is the "you" readers will finally meet.</p>
					<p>If you are still asking yourself, “What is a ghostwriter, and what does a ghostwriter do, exactly?” I'm here to walk you through the process of hiring a ghostwriter for a life story. Every ghostwriter works a little differently, so feel free to call or email so that we can talk in detail about your story, your unique needs, and the ghostwriting process.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
					<p>Here's why I’m one of the best ghostwriters out there.</p>
					<p>I spend my time writing memoirs and performing improv comedy. You heard me right. I perform comedy in front of crowds in and around my home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In ghostwriting, as in comedy, my work is about revealing everyday truths in new and exciting ways. In my experience, readers yearn for an author insightful enough to inject levity into a tragic or frightening situation. In doing so, a memoir writer helps make the experience more memorable and more meaningful.</p>
					<p>I have ghostwritten more than ten memoirs in the last several years and if you will allow me, I'm ready to offer memoir help by honing the poignant and powerful moments of your life into a focused story.</p>
					<p>If we work together, my first task will be to find the core of your story. I'll listen and ask a few questions. I will prompt you to remember the pivotal moments of your life and, together, we will uncover important details that reveal your life as exceptional and unique.</p>
					<p>Throughout this process, we'll uncover the central message of your memoir.</p>
					<p>As a ghostwriter, I work with the clay of your life experiences—selecting the telling moments, leaving out the boring stuff, plumbing deeply for meaning, and working it all into a can't-put-it-down book with your name proudly splashed across the cover.</p>
					<p>Writing memoirs is all about what to put iin, what to leave out . . .</p>
					<p>It's important that we identify the critical events of your life. Interestingly, those moments are not always the most dramatic. These events, however, are the most emotional. These emotional events could include a moment of heartfelt advice from your mother, the day you got married, an injustice you witnessed, or the day you met your spiritual guru. </p>
					<p>As a ghostwriter, my job is to find the story within the story.</p>

						<p>Ruby, you listened, really listened, and told my story back to me in a way that was insightful but also really entertaining.  Sometimes I laughed and cried on the same page.  Having you tell my story as an epic romance, which it really was, made me feel like everything I have been through was for a reason. </p>

				<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
					<p class="p-bold">How To Write a Memoir, Step 1: Finding Deeper Meaning</p>
					<p>Throughout the first month of our work, you and I will talk extensively on the phone, via Skype, or in person. During each meeting, I will ask you to recall the stories you remember most, sense memories that never go away, and details of each scene. Using this background, together we will uncover hidden meanings and emotions. I’ll ask you to be honest and tell the truth without any self-editing — an essential step for all memoir ghostwriting relationships.</p>
					<p class="p-bold">How To Write a Memoir, Step 2: Dealing with Delicate Subjects & Letting Loose</p>
					<p>Our initial interview will include a discussion about which subjects and characters need to be handled with kid gloves. Thereafter you can feel free to simply let loose and describe things exactly as you felt them, knowing I am already aware that certain information (if any) must be dealt with delicately in the pages of the book.</p>
					<p class="p-bold">How To Write a Memoir, Step 3: Going Beneath the Surface</p>
					<p>Your ability to remember sights, sounds, smells, and emotions is crucial to creating an engaging, true-to-life novel. I want to hear your opinions, prejudices, angers, and joys. As your ghostwriter, it’s imperative that I know what lies beneath the surface.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">About Me:<br>Ruby Peru</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
					<p>I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico with my loyal dog, Lightnin' and write in cafés, on couches, in notebooks, on computers, and every place else that's helpless. I'm a perpetual student, always working on improving my craft and adding new skills and new styles to my repertoire. I enjoy ghostwriting because, since these books are assignments--clients ask me to write a particular story, in a particular style--they always challenge me. I learn something new from each book and sometimes get ideas for additional work as well. The ghostwriting assignments inspire my own writing, and vice versa.</p>
					<p>Here in Santa Fe, I host a show called the Santa Fe Speakeasy (The last Thursday of every month. Check us out on Facebook!) where real people tell true stories, live, without notes. We use a tiny little stage in a local pizza parlor, and it's a lot of fun. The group has a loyal following of listeners and storytellers, which is always growing. This is a fun thing I do to bring people together over true stories and to bond the community around celebrating our unique lives and all we have learned from them. We laugh a lot, we shed tears, occasionally, but most of all we--the storytellers of the world--find one another.</p>
					<p>I grew up in a family where dinner table conversation wasn't about how your day was, or what's going on in the news. It was about telling true stories. Us kids always wanted our parents to tell us about the things that happened before we were born and the adventures they went on in their youth. This was how we, as a family, learned who we were and where we fit into society, or why we sometimes didn't. So, maybe that's why I'm so interested in helping others tell their stories.</p>
					<p>To me, the difference between writing fiction and writing memoir isn't as great as you might think. I think when people say "write what you know," that doesn't necessarily mean the exact people, places, and events that you know. I think it means to write the emotional realities that you know. In fact, it's impossible to write an emotional reality you've never experienced. So, whether a book takes the shape of a novel set in a completely fictional world, or a fact-based memoir, or a novel based upon a true story, my clients and I are always writing about emotional realities that are very real, journeys that take us to places we understand. So, that's a little bit about me as a writer and a person. If you want to know more, feel free to get in touch!</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Experience and Education</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
					<p>My path toward becoming a ghostwriter has taken many forms, but the most instructive work I have done on my journey has been one-on-one with excellent teachers. At Carnegie Mellon, I had the opportunity to attend lectures from the great Kurt Vonnegut.  Then, in graduate school, I studied under David Foster Wallace. I saw the source of the outrageous humor, intelligence, and complexity of his work as he made me into a strict grammarian with license to break those rules at will. In my school days, I also learned from Thom Jones, whose short stories bring out immense emotional content with aggressive, undiluted voices. Here in Santa Fe, I've enjoyed the privilege of studying improvisation under the great actor Alan Arkin. During my acting and improv days in New York City, I discovered William Packard, the founder of New York Quarterly. As a playwright and poet, he worked with me on finding new voices, integrating emotion into the work, and discovering unique ways to use imagery.</p>
					<p>Today, my ghostwriting is an attempt to give back much of what my teachers have given me and to honor their memories. Because I recognize the value of working one-on-one with great teachers, I continue to do so. Every year I work with an established or new mentor, developing my craft in a new genre, fleshing out a novel of my own, or perfecting ghostwriting skills. Also, every year I mentor a local writer, helping him or her learn and grow as my teachers did for me.</p>
					<p>Over the past 20 years, I have published extensively in books, magazines, and newspapers. I worked in the editorial department at McGraw Hill Publishing, and contributed to the text in several educational history books. Locally,  as Ruby Peru, Santa Fe writer, I wrote a dating and humor column entitled “Romancing the ‘Fe,” for Santa Fe's Local Flavor magazine, where one of my pieces received a 2008 AIGA New Mexico Showdown award.</p>
					<p>My ghostwriting work is rooted in compassion for people’s life stories and in understanding that those who have led unusual lives are the dreamers and the searchers of this world. I believe the search for truth often leads us down unexpected, sometimes dangerous paths, but, in such a life, there is no room for regret. In my work with clients, I strive to ensure that every moment of a life is celebrated by discovering and revealing the incredible learning experiences we all have along the way.</p>
